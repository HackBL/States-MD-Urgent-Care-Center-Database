# States-MD-Urgent-Care-Center-Database
Urgent care is a walk-in clinic to treat injuries or illnesses requiring immediate care but not serious enough to require a hospital emergency department visit. With the onset of COVID19, they have been more on demand for testing and simple interventions.

This project will design, implement, and test a database for a national chain of urgent care center, called “States MD Urgent Care Center”. The project will need to investigate further about the typical operations in an urgent care clinic and design database accordingly.
